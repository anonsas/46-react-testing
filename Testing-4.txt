Static Analysis Testing - proccess of verifying that your code 
meets certain expectations without actually running it.

"Testing checks if your code works or not. Static Analysis checks if tests are written well or not"
  1. Ensure consistent style and formatting.
  2. Check for common mistakes and possible bugs.
  3. Limit the complexity of code and verify type consistency
  (readability, consistency, error handling, type checking, alignment).

Static Analysis Testing tools:
  TypeScript | ESlint | Prettier | Husky | lint-staged

npm i -D eslint-plugin-jest-dom
npm i -D eslint-config-prettier
npx husky-init && npm (linter and formatter to run before a commit).
lint-staged (runs linter and formatter before .git files are staged).
